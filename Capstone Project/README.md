## Screen Recording
There are two screen recordings showcasing the project in action. Two video files are uploaded first one is for the AutoML part and is found at [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pljy-lahRfYybU3IVOZC3iTnC1Gbt1hw/view?usp=sharing], and the second is for Azure Python SDK can be found at [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xzi1tVsZ6ujMjNjmudrx9qemWADVOA2a/view?usp=sharing].

## Standout Suggestions
In future developments, it would be beneficial to expand testing methodologies for local container and downloaded models, optimize the parallel run step in the pipeline by fine-tuning resource allocation and workload distribution, enhance pipeline automation with version control, and explore advanced performance measurement techniques beyond the Apache Benchmark tool. These efforts will contribute to improved functionality, efficiency, and scalability of the solution.
